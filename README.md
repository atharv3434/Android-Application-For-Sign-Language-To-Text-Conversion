# Android-Application-For-Sign-Language-To-Text-Conversion

Developed an Android application that converts sign language gestures into text using
advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. The app captures gestures via a
webcam, processes the images with segmentation, noise reduction, and feature extraction,
and then uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize the gestures. The
recognized gestures are accurately translated into text, facilitating effective communication for
users. The project was developed using Android Studio with Python and Kotlin on Windows
10.
